# ðŸ§© Wireframing in UI/UX Design

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a simplified visual guide that outlines the structure and layout of a web page or application. It acts as a blueprint, helping designers and developers visualise where elements like buttons, images, and text will appearâ€”**before any actual code is written**.

Wireframes are essential for:
- Clarifying the design direction
- Identifying usability issues early
- Communicating layout ideas with stakeholders
- Planning features and functionality in a logical flow

By using wireframes, teams can **iterate quickly, gather feedback early, and reduce rework**, ultimately leading to better product outcomes.
